Priyanka got an array as input and assigned a task to verify that the reversal of array gives the same array or not. If array and its reverse version both are same then print “ Verified” else print “ Not Verified”.

n=int(input())
inputst=input()
ls=inputst.split()
def Reverse(lst):
    return [ele for ele in reversed(lst)]
rv=Reverse(ls)
if rv == ls:
    print("Verified")
else:
    print("Not Verified")
