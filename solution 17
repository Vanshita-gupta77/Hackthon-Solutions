Pooja has three gloves in his almirah. Each glove has one of 20 possible colours, which are represented by integers between 1 and 20. Specifically, the colours of the gloves are A,B & C.

Pooja has to wear two gloves during winters which have the same colour. Help Pooja find out if that is possible or not.
