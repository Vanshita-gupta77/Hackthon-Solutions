Kavya got the task to find the factorial of a number ‘n’ using recursion in the test, but after completing the test he think about counting the number of zeores in the factorial of number.

He solves the factorial using recursion and also find the number of trailing zeroes in the answer to get complete marks in programming.

n=int(input())
num=0
fact=1
for i in range(1,n+1):
    fact=fact*i
for x in fact:
    if x==0:
        num=num+i
print(num)
